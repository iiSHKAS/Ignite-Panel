# 🌍 Language Support Guide

This guide explains how to add support for a new language to the application by creating a JSON translation file.

## 1. Creating the Language File

* **Location:** The language file should be placed in the designated translations folder for the application.
* **File Name:** Create a new file with the **`.json`** extension. You can name it after the language (e.g., `ar.json`, `es.json`, `en.json`) or any other name you prefer.

---

## 2. JSON File Structure

The JSON file must contain a specific structure for language definition, followed by a dictionary of strings to be translated.

### 2.1. Language Definition

At the beginning of the file, include the following core options:

| Key | Description | Possible Values / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`name`** | The name of the language that will appear to the user within the program. | Example: `"Arabic"` |
| **`translator`** | The name of the translator (Optional). | Example: `"SHKAS"` |
| **`rtl`** | Defines the text direction (Right-to-Left). | **`true`** for RTL languages (like Arabic), and **`false`** otherwise. |

**Definition Structure Example (JSON Code Block):**

```
{
  "name": "Language Name",
  "translator": "Translator (Optional)",
  "rtl": false 
```
2.2. The Strings Section ("strings")
Following the definition section, you must add the "strings" key, which holds all the texts that need translation within the program.

Each entry in this section consists of a key-value pair:

Key: This is the original English text (this must not be changed).

Value: This is the translated text for the new language (fill this part with the translation).

3. The Complete JSON File (Template)
The following template shows the complete structure of the language file. Please fill in the Value part (the text after the colon : ) with the translation for your new language.

Important Note: You must keep the Keys (the text appearing before the colon) exactly as they are, as they represent the original strings in the application.
